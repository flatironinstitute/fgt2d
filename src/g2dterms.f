c      g2dterms - determine number of terms in Hermite/local expansions 
c           for boxes of size "bsize" with Gaussian variance "delta".

      subroutine g2dterms(ndim,bsize,delta,eps,nterms)
c      
c     Determine the number of terms in the Taylor/Hermite expansions 
c     for boxes with side length = bsize
c
c     The error formula is from Wan and Karniadakis 2006 JCP 219 pp. 7-12.
c     Strain derived a similar formula in SIAM J. Sci. Stat. Comput. 12 (5) 
c     (1991) 1131â€“1139, essentially with only "ndim" missing.

c     INPUT:
c     ndim : dimension of the underlying space
c     eps: desired precision
c     delta: Gaussian variance
c     bsize: side length of the box

c     OUTPUT:
c     nterms: number of terms in Taylor/Hermite expansion
